CribMatch is a web application that connects users for co-living based on personality-driven compatibility, using advanced NLP techniques to ensure accurate matching. 
With a responsive interface built using React, Tailwind CSS, and a swipe-based mutual match system, CribMatch matches users based on 9 key lifestyle attributes, such as routines and stress factors.
Compatibility scores are calculated using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to deliver precise, personality-aligned matches.
Built on Django with SQLite3 for scalable data management, CribMatch provides an intuitive and efficient platform for finding ideal co-living partners.
